Instructions before playing game
Objective:
The primary goal of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it.

Card Values:

 Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
 Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
 Ace values are 1 point.
 Gameplay:

 Dealing:

 Each player is dealt two cards, face up.
 The dealer receives one card face up and one card face down (the hole card).
 Player's Turn:

 Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
 Players can continue to hit until they decide to stand or until the total value of their hand 
 exceeds 21, in which case they "bust" and lose the round.
 Dealer's Turn:

 The dealer reveals the hole card.
 The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher. Once the dealer reaches 17 or 
 higher, they must stand.
 If the dealer busts, player win.
 Winning:

 If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21, the player 
 wins.
